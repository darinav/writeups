# 🔐 Security & Blockchain Research Writeups

This repository is my collection of experiments, notes, and research writeups as I learn and practice cybersecurity with a focus on **Web3 security**.

---

## 📂 Experiments
- [Ethereum Transactions, Nonces, and Gas (Sepolia Testnet)](./Sepolia%20Testnet%20Experiment.md)  
  Hands-on lab exploring Ethereum transaction lifecycle:
  - Sent first tx (nonce 0) and verified on Etherscan
  - Forced a stuck tx with low gas (nonce 1)
  - Observed queued tx (nonce 2)
  - Used Replace-by-Fee (RBF) to unblock the account

---

## 🛠️ Focus Areas
- Blockchain fundamentals (Ethereum, Solidity, smart contracts)
- Web security (OWASP Top 10, SQLi, XSS)
- CTFs & wargames (OverTheWire, Ethernaut, picoCTF)
- Red/Blue team crossover skills

---

## 🎯 Goal
To build practical skills in **cybersecurity & blockchain security research**  
and share clear, reproducible writeups that show both **experiments and lessons learned**.
